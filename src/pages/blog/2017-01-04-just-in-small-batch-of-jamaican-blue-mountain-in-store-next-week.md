For those in the know, this may be old news, but I feel it is still just starting to reach the mainstream. The big news on the street is that over the last 5 or so years, the way the web is being built has been rapidly undergoing some important transformations.

The main buzz-word here "serverless", which technically is a lie, but why argue over semantics.  Websites still live on servers of course, but certain technologies have gone out of their way to sheild us from this evilness which has historically caused us so much pain and grief.  It takes me back to the early 2000's where when working in EC1 Central London, our main server's CPU went bang, and we had to jump on numerous trains and go to Global Switch or some other data center and physically replace the CPU etc while the clients rang non-stop to find out why their website was down.

These days we have amazing cloud structures which handle all of that for us, but even better than that now, we have services like Netlify, which host and build our websites on global Edge CDNs which scale as required and hide all of that tricky stuff from us.  Which means more time for us to focus on building better software and a better website to live on this new better hardware. Happy days!
