title: Proud to have worked with these industry beaters

Kinesis Technologies has been lucky to have been involved in some
  amazing projects in the few years we have been around.  Making an effective
  difference at each business we visit, we hope to leave behind a legacy which
  can be built upon further and used for positive change.

**Disrupting with disrupters**

Each of the businesses below have been known to be disrupters in their own
industries, which is something we thrive to do.  We live for the challenge
of pushing things forward and helping to evolve the technological landscapes
on which we stand.

For this reason, it makes me very happy to have had the opportunity of working with these each and every one of these amazing businesses.



## BMIGroup

Currently we are working with BMIGroup in reading assisting with a project to bring over 100 countries and individual software platforms together into a single brand and solution. We are harnessing cloud technologies and devops to bring this project to fruition. (MORE TO COME SOON)

## Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains

Kinesis Technologies has been involved in helping to develop and build new features for Mercedes’ in house Change Management Software. This is the software which manages the changes and upgrades for the current 5 times world champions’ Formula 1 Engines, as well as their new Formula E Powertrains and also the engines for their new X1 HyperCar. Based at the engine factory in Brixworth, Northamptonshire, Kinesis Technologies has been primarily working in **C# & VB.NET** on this project. Gaining some experience in how scrum teams work within large corporations, this experience has been invaluable. Also the chance to work within one of Kinesis Technologies favourite areas, motorsport, has given us the chance to put some of our automotive knowledge to good use.



## Avanti Netherlands & PeugeotCitroen Group

This contract was a to assist development on a couple of projects for a development agency based in the Netherlands. The first piece was a HR system for **Peugeot Citroen Group**. This was upgraded from Angular 5 to 6, and many new features built upon to deliver the client’s requirements. The second piece of work, which is currently being completed, is a small **Content Management System**, which will be used to dynamically build other back- end systems, also using **.Net Core 2.3** and **Angular 6**. TDD has been used on both projects, along with a CI/CD pipeline and code reviews by the Tech Director of 24coms.
